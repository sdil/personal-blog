Hi there!

My name is Fadhil Yaacob (pronounce [Fa-dale](https://www.howtopronounce.com/fadale/)). I am a Software Engineer at Onapp CDN. You can read more about my working experience here. Read [here](/blog/greetings) to know me in detail.

During my free time, I enjoy shredding my guitar. You can see some videos in my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/piukul/)
